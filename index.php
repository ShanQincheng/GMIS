                <p>GMIS is to provide a method for students to see when, and where, all their out-of-class group project meetings are. It will also allow them to see when group members might be available for an ad hoc meeting. A student will be able to add themselves to a group and enter the group meeting time for each unit. Students will enter their basic information and a photo or picture and either add their group or select from already added groups. </p>
